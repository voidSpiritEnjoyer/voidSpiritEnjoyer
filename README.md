## Hi there 👋

My name is Ilnur, and here are some facts about me: 
- I'm 20 years old 🥱
- I want to become a developer and my choice fell on the frontend 🤥
- I'm studying on my own (Hope I will successfully cope with all the difficulties)) 🧐
- Even though I am getting a higher education as a lawyer, it seems to me that coding is for me 👨‍🎓

Okay, now there are no more interesting facts, it’s worth starting to list the not so interesting ones.😋

At the moment, I can use:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- SCSS
- REACT

My telegram: @ilnurasd. I'm always open for an interesting conversation. 🥰🥺
